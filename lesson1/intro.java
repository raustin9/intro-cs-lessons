// Welcome to your first program in Java!
// This program simply prints out the text "Hello World" to the console.

// All programs in Java are written in something called a "class" 
// Is this silly? Yes.
// Is this annoying? Also yes.
// Does this stop Java from being one of the most used languages? Sadly, no.
// For now, just know that this class is what your program will run
// You can call this class anything, and when you run "javac" to compile it,
// it will output a ".class" file with the name of what you name this class.
class HelloWorld {
    // This is the "main" function
    // When you run the command "java HelloWorld" to run this, this "function"
    // is what the computer will actually run. We will cover functions soon and 
    // this will make more sense then. 
    // For now, whatever you want to program, put it in the "main" function
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // This is the line that actually prints out the text!
        // "System.out.println" tells the computer to "print this line out to the console"
        // The syntax of this may be confusing for now, but it will make 
        // more sense very soon
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
